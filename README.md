# Credit Card Customer Segmentation : Clustering

To better understand the behavior of customers, the segmentation is done by KMeans Clustering. It will help banks to target their marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and to create customized offers. For analysis, the dataset has been taken from Kaggle.

This analysis has revealed four major groups of credit card customers: 

1. The first group consists of active users who use their credit cards frequently for various purchases.

2. The second group comprises customers who do not use their credit cards for installment payments.

3. The third group includes customers who primarily use their credit cards for installment payments.

4. The fourth group consists of customers who use their credit cards for cash withdrawals.
